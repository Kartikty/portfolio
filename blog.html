                <h2>Learn HTML- In fun way</h2>
                <p>HTM or HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. It's a file format used for containing HTML language which constructs a web page. This file format is based on markup codes intended to be used in Web Browsers. HTM contains formatted text, images, and other elements in a way that can be translated with web browsers.

            <h2>Learn CSS- In fun way</h2>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

        <h2>Learn React js- In fun way</h2>
        <p>ReactJS is JavaScript library used for building reusable UI components. According to React official documentation, following is the definition âˆ’

            React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native. React implements one-way reactive data flow, which reduces the boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.</p>
